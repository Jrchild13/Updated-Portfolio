        <h2>Where My Life Truly Began</h2>
        <p>
            At the age of 15 was when I had finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life.
            I was visiting my uncle for a few weeks during the summer before football workouts began, it was a Tuesday I believe when I had gotten 
            bored and wen't looking for my uncle to go have some fun out at the nearby camp he owned and to go swimming. When I had walked into his home office he happend to be working on a project for work,
            well being a young and curious teen I had asked what he was doing. He was excited to see that I was interested in what he was doing and sat me down and started explaining/teaching me what he had been working on.
            I was instantly hooked! After he had taught me a few basics I was so curious and interested to get into Computer Programming and make it my proffession. School eventualy started a few months later and I still had 
            this crazy want to learn more about this programming profession my uncle showed me earlier in the summer that I signed up for 1 programming class a semester. Time flew by and it was then my senior year in 2018, I continued on my path taking 1 computer class in both semesters.\
            In the blink of an eye the school year ended. I needed to work during the summer to help pay for college and anything else I wanted to do when the time came for me to go to WCU in the fall. When I had gotten to WCU, I took a computer programming course my first semester. Sadly that
            was when I had realized that what I was tought in high school wasn't nearly anything like what we would learn in college. We had jumped straight into C# and I had known nothing going in to the course. When the semester ended I had come 
            to the conclusion that I needed to save up some money to take a summer bootcamp course to help fast track my learning in not only the subjects I would learn in school but also for any job I would get after. It was about a year before I had the money for the bootcamp course but I did it.
            I had saved up enough to attend the course. I showed up for the first day and it had turned out that I was the youngest in the class, I had felt out of place but I knew that in the long run it work out so I pushed through and persevered. After the course was over I was ready to tackle 
            on the courses that I wanted to overcome in school, then I realized that I needed more money to go back so I just went back to working in manual labor. After a few years of me needing to go back and forth between working full time and then attending school full time, my uncle noticed that 
            I needed some help, he offered me to teach me and give me a place to stay for a few months to help me fast-track my studies, his end goal was for me to either be an intern or a full time software engineer for a reputable company of my choice. Close to 3 months into the intership is where the story ends, 
            I have made this entire page on March 24th, 2022. This portfolio is to be used as an example of my work that I have learned over the past 3 months of my intership and to also act as my "blog".
