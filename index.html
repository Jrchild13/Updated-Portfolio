                    <h2>Where My Life Journey Truly Began</h2>
                    <p>
                        At the age of 15 was when I had finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life.
                        I was visiting my uncle for a few weeks during the summer before football workouts began, it was a Tuesday I believe when I had gotten 
                        bored and wen't looking for my uncle to go have some fun out at the nearby camp he owned and to go swimming. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I had walked into his home office he happend to be working on a project for work,
                        well being a young and curious teen I had asked what he was doing. He was excited to see that I was interested in what he was doing and sat me down and started explaining/teaching me what he had been working on.
                        I was instantly hooked! After he had taught me a few basics, I was so curious and interested to get into Computer Programming and make it my proffession just like my uncle. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        School eventualy started a few months later and I still had 
                        this crazy desire to learn more about this programming profession my uncle showed me earlier in the summer, that I decided to sign up for 1 programming/computer class a semester. Time flew by, it was like a blink of the eye and it was already my senior year in 2018. I was determined to continued on my path taking 1 computer class in both semesters.
                        I was so focused on my studies that the last semester(5-6 months), that I didn't realize that my time in high school had run out until the priciple was handing me my diploma. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I needed to work during the summer to help pay for college and anything else I wanted to do when the time came for me to go to WCU in the fall. When I had gotten to WCU, I took a computer programming course my first semester. Sadly that
                        was when I had realized that what I was tought in high school wasn't nearly anything like what we would learn in college. We had jumped straight into C# and I had known nothing going in to the course. When the semester ended I had come 
                        to the conclusion that I needed to save up some money to take a summer bootcamp course to help fast track my learning in not only the subjects I would learn in school but also for any job I would get after.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was about a year before I had the money for the bootcamp course but I did it.
                        I had saved up enough to attend the course. I showed up for the first day and it had turned out that the course was made for people who wanted to learn more programming skills to progress in their carrerrs and for people who where just getting into programming. It turned out that 
                        I was the youngest in the class surrounded by 35+ year olds and that I was the only person their to learn basics as a beginner. I had felt out of place but I knew that in the long run, it would pay off so I pushed through and persevered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the course was over I was ready to tackle on the courses that I wanted to overcome in school, but I had quickly realized that I needed more money to go back so I just went back to working in manual labor. After a few years of me needing to go back and forth between working full time and then attending a semester of school at a time, my uncle noticed that 
                        I needed some help with my studies and funds for school. He offered to teach me and give me a place to stay for a few months to help me fast-track my studies since it was going to take me 2-3 times longer than the average student to graduate school, his end goal was for me to either be an intern or a full time software engineer for a reputable company of my choice.

                        Close to 3 months into the intership is where the story ends for now, 
                        I have been working on this entire set of page's(which is my first "webpage" ever attempted) from March 21st, 2022 - March 31st, 2022. This portfolio is to be used as an example of my work that I have learned over the past 3 months of my intership and to also act as my "blog".
